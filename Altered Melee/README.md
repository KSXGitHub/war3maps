## Tips and Tricks

### Must-Do's

* [Kills as many powerful creeps as possible](#creeping)
* [Build as many Level 3 Town Halls as possible](#base-defense)

### Base Defense

Level 3 Town Halls is the best method of defense. Each type of Level 3 Town Hall has its own method of repairing building (healing spells) and destroying invader forces. This does not mean Towers are useless, they have abilities as well.

#### Repair (Heal) Buildings

##### For non Town Halls

* Castle and Fortress can cast Holy Light.
* Fortress can cast Spirit Lin.
* Black Citable can cast Death Coil.
* Tree of Eternity can cast Healing Wave and Resurrection.

##### For Town Halls

* Castle and Fortress can cast Hit Point Regain.
* Fortress has Reincarnation.
* Black Citadel can cast Death Pact to sacrifice an undead building.
* Tree of Eternity can cast Healing Wave.

#### Destroy invader forces

##### Level 3 Town Halls

* They all have Attack ability:
  * Castle can attack multiple enemies at the same time.
  * Fortress can only attack ground units by can also Ensnare flying units.
  * Black Citadel's attack has a chance of Frost Nova targeted unit.
  * Tree of Eternity has ranged attack.
* They all cannot be frozen by Frost Wyrm nor clouded by Dragonhawk Rider.
* They all have spells that can destroy multiple enemy units:
  * Castle can cast Bomb on a building near invading enemy units making it explodes.
  * Fortress can cast Shockwave.
  * Black Citadel can cast Animated Dead and Rain of Chaos.
  * Tree of Eternity can cast Starfall.

#### Gold Mine defense

* For Night Elf, Entangled Gold Mine is invulnerable.
* For Undead, Haunted Gold Mine has Invulnerable Shield (a modified version of Divine Shield).

### Destroy enemy base

Numerous armies are not enough to overcome enemies' defenses. You also need powerful items and powerful mercenaries. See [Creeping](#creeping).

### Creeping

Powerful creeps drop powerful items:
  * Level 10 creeps usually drop level 7 or level 8 items.
  * Level 15 creeps and level 10 neutral hostile heroes usually drop powerful items.
  * Level 18 creeps usually drop Portal of Recall which summons said creeps.

### Harass enemy base from afar

* Castle's and Fortress's Holy Light and Black Citadel's Death Coil can target buildings in any place.
* Some items (drop by level 15 creeps) have spell that can be cast from afar:
  * Eye of Sargeras has Blink, Earthquake and Eye Fragment.
  * Axe of Shockwave can send a shockwave that go on until map boundary.
  * Wand of the God enables user to cast Monsoon from far away.
* Ancients Guardian's rooted form (level 18 mercenary) can attack enemy units in any place visible.
* Level 18 Green Dragon can summon a Chimaera that can teleport to anywhere with Blink ability.

### Defense against powerful magic-immune heroes

Some items give their holder magic immunity, this makes stopping them from doing damage is impossible with normal spells. However, some items/mercenaries allow you do this:
* Devour:
  * Most Level 18 Dragon (except Nether).
* Doom:
  * Bomb of Fire (item).
  * Demonic Figurine (item).
  * Level 18 Nether Dragon (unit).
  * Eredar Warlock (level 18 unit).
  * Warlock's Spell Book (item) has a spell that sacrifices your hero to summon Eredar Warlock.
* Soul Burn attack:
  * All types of Fire Elemental (level 10, 15, 18 units) when disable incinerate.

### Item Combo

* Advanced Orb of Lightning and Axe of Shockwave should always be placed before other orb items.
* Don't equip with duplicate items unless it only change stats.
* Some spellbook items also have orb ability, such as Eye of Sargeras and Tech-Tools.

### Some mercenaries are benefited from Research
