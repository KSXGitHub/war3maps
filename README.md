# My Warcraft III maps

This is a repository of maps I created a long time ago.

## Folders

Some folders have a `README.md` file that contains more detailed information and rules.

### Altered Melee

Contains maps with some very powerful creeps, mercs, and items.

### Capturing

Maps with a particular way of building: Instead of using worker to build things, players "capture" buildings by attacking.

#### 1x

Players capture "platform" and upgrade it to desired building.

#### 2x

Players capture buildings, no upgrade.

### Melee

Maps from [Altered Melee](#altered-melee) but with unaltered object data, custom units/items are replaced with normal ones.

### Minicraft

Melee games with over-simplistic builds.

### preview

Used to test units and items from [Altered Melee](#altered-melee).

### junks

Garbage maps I created for fun with no logic what-so-ever.
