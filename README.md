# My Warcraft III maps

This is a repository of maps I created a long time ago.

## Folders

Some folders have a `README.md` file that contains more detailed information and rules.

### [Altered Melee](./Altered%20Melee)

Contains maps with some very powerful creeps, mercs, and items.

### [Capturing](./Capturing)

Maps with a particular way of building: Instead of using worker to build things, players "capture" buildings by attacking.

#### [1x](./Capturing/1x)

Players capture "platform" and upgrade it to desired building.

#### [2x](./Capturing/2x)

Players capture buildings, no upgrade.

### [Melee](./Melee)

Maps from [Altered Melee](#altered-melee) but with unaltered object data, custom units/items are replaced with normal ones.

### [Minicraft](./Minicraft)

Melee games with over-simplistic builds.

### [preview](./preview)

Used to test units and items from [Altered Melee](#altered-melee).

### [junks](./junks)

Garbage maps I created for fun with no logic what-so-ever.
