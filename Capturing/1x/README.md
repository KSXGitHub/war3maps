# Capturing 1x

Unlike traditional melee maps where players use workers to build structures, in Capturing, players will instead capture them by attacking.

## Defeat Condition

* Player is defeated when all their Town Halls are destroyed.
* Player wins when all their enemies are defeated.

## Resource Gathering

### Traditional Resource Gathering

You can use your workers to mine golds and gather lumbers.

### Buildings that generate resources periodically

* Every player receives 25*N gold every 15 seconds with N being number of constructed Farms, Burrows, Ziggurats, or Moon Well.
* Every player receives 15*N lumber every 12 seconds with N being number of constructed Lumber Mills, War Mills, Graveyards, or Hunter Halls.

## Building

Players do not use their workers to build structures (except Haunted Gold Mine), instead they capture a building by attacking enemies' structure. Upon a building's destruction:
* If destroyed building was built from a Platform, it will be replaced by a new Platform, which can be upgraded to functional buildings.
* If destroyed building is a neutral building (such as Tavern, Mercenary Camp, Goblin Laboratory), it will be replaced by the same building.

## Superweapons

When a match lasts for too long but no players show side of defeat, it is where expensive superweapon upgrades come in to play. Every race has superweapon upgrades. To unlock them, player first need to upgrade and research all normal ones.

## Tips and Tricks

### Build Level 3 Town Halls as fast as possible

Level 3 Town Halls are powerful means to defense your base and attack your enemy.

### Don't destroy too many of your own buildings

There are punishment in economy for doing this.
