# Capturing 1x

Unlike traditional melee maps where players use workers to build structures, in Capturing, players will instead capture them by attacking.

## Defeat Condition

* Player is defeated when all their Town Halls are destroyed.
* Player wins when all their enemies are defeated.

## Resource Gathering

### Traditional Resource Gathering

You can use your workers to mine golds and gather lumbers.

### Buildings that generate resources periodically

* Every player receives 25*N gold every 15 seconds with N being number of constructed Farms, Burrows, Ziggurats, or Moon Well.
* Every player receives 15*N lumber every 12 seconds with N being number of constructed Lumber Mills, War Mills, Graveyards, or Hunter Halls.

## Do's and Dont's

### Build Level 3 Town Halls as fast as possible

Level 3 Town Halls are powerful means to defense your base and attack your enemy.

### Don't destroy too many of your own buildings

There are punishment in economy for doing this.
